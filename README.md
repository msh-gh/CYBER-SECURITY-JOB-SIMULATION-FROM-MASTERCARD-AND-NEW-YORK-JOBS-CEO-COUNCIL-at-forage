Mastercard Cybersecurity virtual experience program on Forage - August 2024
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Completed a job simulation where I served as an analyst on Mastercard’s
   Security Awareness Team 
 * Helped identify and report security threats such as phishing 
 * Analyzed and identified which areas of the business needed more robust
   security training and implemented training courses and procedures for those
   teams

I recently participated in Mastercard's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Security Awareness team at Mastercard.
I worked on a project to identify phishing emails and design security awareness training courses. Through this job simulation, I built my skills in problem-solving, data analysis, and data presentation and practiced them in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working in cybersecurity and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Security Awareness team at a company like Mastercard.
